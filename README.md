# exotica_val_description

Minimal `val_description` variant used for unit testing and examples in [EXOTica](https://github.com/ipab-slmc/exotica). It is based on an old version of the original `val_description` package by NASA, stripped off its hundreds of megabytes of old/retired meshes, actuator coefficients, and xacros. 

For the original and maintained `val_description`, please [see here](https://gitlab.com/nasa-jsc-robotics/val_description).
